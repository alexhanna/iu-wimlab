      "Python is an all-purpose programming language which can be used for collecting, cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing data. With a vibrant development community, tasks which may have taken several different tools can be accomplished with this simple, intuitive language. \n",

      "## What we're doing today\n",
      "\n",
      "This workshop is an introduction to the basics of the Python programming language. The workshop will focus on the basics of the language, how to collect and analyze social data (with an emphasis on social media sites). We will introduce statistical data analysis with Python\u2019s scientific computing packages. \n",

      "We're not going to get to everything today, but hopefully this will give you enough of a start to get your bearings and learn more.\n",

      "\n",
      "We're going to use [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) as a way to jumpstart everyone so we spend more of our time coding and learning rather than setting up. IPython notebooks are a great way to group your code, documentation, and code output in one place. You can see that I also like to use it as a means of creating workshops.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this workshop is done, you can install your own instance of Python using the Continuum Analytics Anaconda distribution [https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). Anaconda is a great distribution because it bundles together a lot of scientific computing tools, including SciPy, pandas, and IPython.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing you need to do is to enter the address I gave you at the beginning of the lab into your address bar. You'll probably get a message that says something like \"Do you really want to continue?\" Go ahead and click yes.\n",

      "If you're successful, you should be getting a screen which looks like this.\n",

      "The password for this notebook is <code>wimlab1234</code>. When you enter the notebook, you should get a listing of all the notebooks which have been created. Click \"New Notebook\" to create a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](newnb.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, the **VERY FIRST** thing you should do is change the name of your notebook by clicking on the text that says *Untitled0*. Rename the notebook to unique name, like your last name + \"-Lab\".\n",
